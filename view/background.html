		<h3>Why Bear Drone ? </h3>

				Over the summer of 2014, the SENSE Research Group was approached about a research project with Spain and Brazil concerning a wide area wireless network of sensors to detect a forest fire when it begins rather than when it threatens society. At the beginning of the conversation, Chris felt that a project of this size would be fairly uneconomical in the sense of maintaining that many sensors even on a monthly basis would be hell. It was around this time that we found a Professor in Spain that had a working model for forest fires and that he was looking for a way to get some information from the fire to help make the model more accurate. Bob and I talked about it at length and came to the conclusion that a mobile platform would be the most efficient method of collecting data from a forest fire. The SENSE Research Group decided that they wanted to continue their research for the Wide Area Sensor network but Professor Baiocchi felt that my idea for a Drone type platform would make for an interesting project. And thus this project was created.

				After further research, we found that no one had collected this kind of data in the means of which we had planed. We took this as a good sign and began looking into options that would provide us this data.

				Given a drone, we want to gather wind velocity. The drone should be remote control and follow FAA regulation of safety and human privacy. This drone needs to be as low cost as possible, for example, we will 3D print some specials to save money. Also, the drone and all parts included have to weigh less than 2 kg.  A sensor base will be attach onto the drone to sense wind speed and direction. Wind information and data  will be collected and transmitted to base station through wireless connection.
