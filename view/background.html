		<h3>Why Bear Drone ? </h3>

				Over the summer of 2014, the SENSE Research Group was approached about a research project with Spain and Brazil concerning a wide area wireless network of sensors to detect a forest fire when it begins rather than when it threatens society. At the beginning of the conversation, Chris felt that a project of this size would be fairly uneconomical in the sense of maintaining that many sensors even on a monthly basis would be hell. It was around this time that we found a Professor in Spain that had a working model for forest fires and that he was looking for a way to get some information from the fire to help make the model more accurate. Bob and I talked about it at length and came to the conclusion that a mobile platform would be the most efficient method of collecting data from a forest fire. The SENSE Research Group decided that they wanted to continue their research for the Wide Area Sensor network but Professor Baiocchi felt that my idea for a Drone type platform would make for an interesting project. And thus this project was created.

				After further research, we found that no one had collected this kind of data in the means of which we had planed. We took this as a good sign and began looking into options that would provide us this data.

		<h3> Proof of Concept: Wind Speed and Direction </h3>
		<hr align='left' width='25%'>
		<div class="bg-paragraph">
			<p>
			<strong>Abstract:</strong> Using a mobile platform, collecting accurate wind speed and direction. We will be testing a method for collecting wind speed and direction from a mobile platform, in this case a flying drone. We will be testing a Pitot tube installed in a wind vane with a digital compass with magnetometer to give us Wind Speed and Wind Direction. This is just one method while others existed we will only be testing this one in consideration to the needs of our customer.

			This project is being done to facilitate a long term research project of creating a drone that can be deployed to the front of the forest fire to collect microclimate wind information to make a mathematical model more accurate in predicting the movement of a forest fire. This way we can give more accurate data than presently provided to help put people in the right places to control forest fires.
