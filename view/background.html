				 Using a mobile platform, collecting accurate wind speed and direction. We will be testing a method for collecting wind speed and direction from a mobile platform, in this case a flying drone. We will be testing a Pitot tube installed in a wind vane with a digital compass with magnetometer to give us Wind Speed and Wind Direction. This is just one method while others existed we will only be testing this one in consideration to the needs of our customer.

				This project is being done to facilitate a long term research project of creating a drone that can be deployed to the front of the forest fire to collect microclimate wind information to make a mathematical model more accurate in predicting the movement of a forest fire. This way we can give more accurate data than presently provided to help put people in the right places to control forest fires.
